Welcome to my 100 Days of Code in Python challenge! 🚀 Over the course of 100 consecutive days, I dedicated time daily to learn, practice, and build using Python. This journey not only deepened my programming knowledge but also helped me form a consistent coding habit.

Each day, I explored a unique topic, concept, or mini-project – ranging from Python fundamentals and OOP to data structures, algorithms, web development, APIs, automation, and machine learning basics. I documented my progress through clean code, comments, and mini write-ups.
